# AssembleComputer
PC project 
For my BuildMyComputer Java project, I created several classes for PC components, including Case, Motherboard, Monitors, Resolution, and Sizes, as well as a PC class. I used my previous project, BuildBedroom, as a guide for organizing the classes and constructors. Each class has fields, ways to set and get values, and methods to show information about the parts. In BuildMyComputer.java, I created objects for each part, combined them into a PC object, and printed the PCâ€™s details.
